Final Exam Quiz
What is the different between the tables created using VIEWS and the tables created using SELECT INTO ?

* SELECT INTO created a table that is structured with a set number of columns and a boundless number of columns
so you can apply all the SQL querying commands on the the resulted table.

* But VIEWS is treated as  virtual tables that is extracted from a database So you cannot apply all the SQL querying
commands on the the resulted table as joins.
